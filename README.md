Run the following:

1. python manage.py makemigrations picnmix

2. python manage.py migrate

3. python populate_picnmix.py



This will create 3 example users, 'Alice', 'Bob', and 'Eve'. You can log in as any of these users with 'password'.

There are also a number of albums with pictures already uploaded, 'London', 'San Francisco', 'Mauritius', 'Skiing', and 'Great Wall of China'.  

You can browse through all of the users albums and photos, as well as share and delete individual albums and photos.

You will see that each album has an owner, and users that it has been shared with. You can share the albums with other people, upload or delete photos, or delete the albums themselves.

You are also able to register yourself, and create and share albums with other users.
