### Instructions

Run the following to create users and populate albums with photos:

1. python manage.py makemigrations picnmix

2. python manage.py migrate

3. python populate_picnmix.py

For simplicity, the virtual environment has been kept the same as for Rango.

This will create 3 example users, 'Alice', 'Bob', and 'Eve'. You can log in as any of these users with 'password'.

There are a number of albums with pictures already set up, 'London', 'San Francisco', 'Mauritius', 'Skiing', and 'Great Wall of China'.

You can browse through all of the users albums and photos, as well as share and delete individual albums and photos.

You will see that each album has an owner, and users that it has been shared with. You can share the albums with other people, upload or delete photos, or delete the albums themselves.

### You can also register yourself, and create and share albums with other users.

### An already set-up version is available on PythonAnywhere at <http://0404070c.pythonanywhere.com/>
